## Exercise
Your product manager has created a ticket with the following feedback from your customer.

"I have to be honest, the new TODO app sucks. It seems to crash all the time. Also when I add a new to do, the IDs don't seem to be working quite right. When I go and check my TODOs, it doesn't work at all and on the off chance it does, sometimes I get back an empty response. Can you fix this please?"

After an initial investigation, it seems there are four major issues with the exercise application.  Can you fix them all?
